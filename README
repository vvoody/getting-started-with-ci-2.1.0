There is a tutorial about getting start with CodeIgniter on IBM
developerWorks[1]. But it was based on CodeIgniter 1.6.2, a little bit
obsolete. So I modified the source codes to make that demo site in the
tutorial run under CodeIgniter 2.1.0(latest version).

To view the difference, git clone & git diff old new.
